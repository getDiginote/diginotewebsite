                  <h2>One of my fondest memories of my childhood involve playing outside, or playing on the Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation my family owned. Over time I grew out of playing those consoles, but their impact on me is still noticeable today. America is referred to as a Melting Pot of different cultures for a reason. There are influences from cultures within Africa, Europe, and South America in our Modern Culture. One of the more overlooked cultures is Urban Culture in Japan and its influence on America. Japan’s urban culture can be seen throughout America and can be seen more commonly in the teenagers and young adults of America. By way of Television, The Internet, and video games, Urban Culture in Japan affects young Americans</h2>x

                  <h2>By way of Television, Urban Culture in Japan affects young Americans. Japanese media’s affect on American teens mainly comes in the form of Anime. Anime has become teenagers’ most watched genre of animation with its heavier topics like mental health, relationships, and romance paired with unique art styles. Some might argue that anime has been harmful to teenagers and has been linked to teens being more introverted. While this may be true, a good amount of Anime tends to promote a sense of community and friendship within its themes. Some of the most popular anime have teamwork with people found all throughout the stories with everyone working towards one goal. Anime also promotes a sense of community and togetherness with the many anime related events and conventions that happen within the states. Anime’s effect mainly depends on the type of anime one can watch. Though the growth and spread of anime wouldn’t be possible without one emerging aspect of modern Japan, The Internet.</h2>
                  <br>
                  <h2>By way of the Internet, Urban Culture in Japan affects American teenagers. Technology in Japan has historically been around 10 years more advanced than western civilization. The Internet in Japan has had a major boom and evolved before the Internet in places like America. One might say that the Internet in Japan doesn’t resemble much of the Internet in America and that website layouts have a stark contrast to its western counterparts. Despite being a very valid point, Aspects of the internet in Japan were adapted over time to meet the standards and limitations. Also, Japanese people tend to use the same Social Media platforms that are used in America. Other aspects of Japanese culture, like the art and music, are able to spread around not just America, but the world and influence the tastes of teenagers and expose them to modern Japanese culture. Social Media, while being a huge perpetrator of affecting American Teens, is not the only way that urban Japanese affects American teens.
                  </h2>
                  <br>
                  <h2>By way of Video Games, Urban Culture in Japan affects American teenagers. The advancement of modern Japanese video games has led to video gaming being popularized all over the world.The world's most popular video companies, like Nintendo, Capcom, Namco, and Square Enix, are all Japanese companies and have a massive market cap in the American gaming industry. Especially Nintendo, who is credited to have revived video gaming from its massive decline, during the video game crash. Many can argue that the advancement of video games led to the development of Gacha Games. Gacha games are built off predatory gambling mechanics and are targeted towards teenagers, who easily fall prey to these concepts. While this is true, parental controls and parental monitoring can easily prevent children from playing these types of games and spending money on them. Additionally, Lawmakers are passing bills adding restrictions to these types of games. Further protecting young teenagers from falling into the deep pit of having a gambling addiction. </h2>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Now that we know the effects that Japanese Urban culture has on American teens, some may wonder, What other societies does Japan’s urban culture affect? Well, these aspects of Japan, not only affect American teens, but also Brazilian Teens and French Teens. France and Brazil are countries with the highest number of viewers watching Anime. Not only that, the Internet and video games are global phenomena and affect the entire world. Where these same effects on American teenagers can be observed. Japan’s affect on the world can’t be overlooked and we’re at a point where it can’t be minimized.</h2>
